# Chess Image Generation: Synthetic to Real

Welcome to our project! This site documents our work on generating realistic chess images from synthetic data.

---

## 1. Abstract

Concise summary of the project:

- **Problem:** Bridging the gap between synthetic and real chess images.  
- **Approach:** Using AI-based image generation and domain adaptation techniques.  
- **Main Results:** Realistic chess images closely resembling real photographs, validated by quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

---

## 2. Introduction

- **Task and Motivation:** Generate realistic chess images for training and research purposes.  
- **Challenges and Goals:** Visual fidelity, variety of chessboards and pieces, domain gap between synthetic and real data.  
- **Main Contributions:**  
  1. Novel pipeline for converting synthetic chess images to realistic style.  
  2. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of realism.  
  3. Open-source dataset and code.

## 5. Experiments

- **Dataset Description:** Size, source, train/validation/test splits.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** e.g., FID, PSNR, accuracy.  
- **Baselines and Comparisons:** Compare your method against previous methods.  
- **Quantitative Results:** Tables, numbers:

| Method | Metric1 | Metric2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Ours   | 0.92   | 45.1   |
| Baseline | 0.85 | 38.7   |

- **Qualitative Results:** Visualizations of generated images:

## 6. Ablation Study

Demonstrate the importance of each component:

- **Remove Component Y:** Effect on results.  
- **Remove Component Z:** Effect on results.  

| Variant | Metric1 | Metric2 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Full model | 0.92 | 45.1 |
| Without Y  | 0.88 | 42.0 |
| Without Z  | 0.87 | 41.5 |

- Clear explanations of why each component is necessary.
